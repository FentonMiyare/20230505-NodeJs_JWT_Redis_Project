                Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of or limitations
                on implied warranties or the limitations on the applicable
                statutory rights of a consumer, so some or all of the above
                exclusions and limitations may not apply to you.
              </p>

              <h2>Limitation of Liability</h2>
              <p>
                Notwithstanding any damages that you might incur, the entire
                liability of TheTOP.org and any of its suppliers under any
                provision of this Agreement and your exclusive remedy for all of
                the foregoing shall be limited to the amount actually paid by
                you for the website.
              </p>

              <p>
                To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, in no event
                shall TheTOP.org or its suppliers be liable for any special,
                incidental, indirect, or consequential damages whatsoever
                (including, but not limited to, damages for loss of profits, for
                loss of data or other information, for business interruption,
                for personal injury, for loss of privacy arising out of or in
                any way related to the use of or inability to use the website,
                third-party software and/or third-party hardware used with the
                website, or otherwise in connection with any provision of this
                Agreement), even if TheTOP.org or any supplier has been advised
                of the possibility of such damages and even if the remedy fails
                of its essential purpose.
              </p>

              <p>
                Some states/jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or
                limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so the above
                limitation or exclusion may not apply to you.
              </p>

                or invalid, such provision will be changed and interpreted to
                accomplish the objectives of such provision to the greatest
                extent possible under applicable law and the remaining
                provisions will continue in full force and effect.
              </p>

                require performance of an obligation under this Agreement shall
                not effect a party's ability to exercise such right or require
