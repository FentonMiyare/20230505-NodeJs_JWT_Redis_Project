              <h2>How Do We Use Your Email Address?</h2>
              <p>
                By submitting your email address on this website, you agree to
                receive emails from us. You can cancel your participation in any
                of these email lists at any time by clicking on the opt-out link
                or other unsubscribe option that is included in the respective
                email.
              </p>
              <p>
                We only send emails to people who have authorized us to contact
                them, either directly, or through a third party. We do not send
                unsolicited commercial emails, because we hate spam as much as
                you do.
              </p>
              <p>
                By submitting your email address, you also agree to allow us to
                use your email address for customer audience targeting on sites
                like Facebook, where we display custom advertising to specific
                people who have opted-in to receive communications from us.
                Email addresses submitted only through the order processing page
                will be used for the sole purpose of sending you information and
                updates pertaining to your order.
              </p>
              <p>
                If, however, you have provided the same email to us through
                another method, we may use it for any of the purposes stated in
                this Policy. Note: If at any time you would like to unsubscribe
                from receiving future emails, we include detailed unsubscribe
                instructions at the bottom of each email.
              </p>

              <h2>How Long Do We Keep Your Information?</h2>
              <p>
                We keep your information only so long as we need it to provide
                TheTOP.org to you and fulfill the purposes described in this
                policy. This is also the case for anyone that we share your
                information with and who carries out services on our behalf.
              </p>
              <p>
                When we no longer need to use your information and there is no
                need for us to keep it to comply with our legal or regulatory
                obligations, we’ll either remove it from our systems or
                depersonalize it so that we can't identify you.
              </p>

              <h2>How Do We Protect Your Information?</h2>
              <p>
                We implement a variety of security measures to maintain the
                safety of your personal information when you place an order or
                enter, submit, or access your personal information. We offer the
                use of a secure server.
              </p>
              <p>
                All supplied sensitive/credit information is transmitted via
                Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology and then encrypted into our
                Payment gateway providers database only to be accessible by
                those authorized with special access rights to such systems, and
                are required to keep the information confidential.
              </p>
              <p>
                After a transaction, your private information (credit cards,
                social security numbers, financials, etc.) is never kept on
                file. We cannot, however, ensure or warrant the absolute
                security of any information you transmit to TheTOP.org or
                guarantee that your information on the Service may not be
                accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by a breach of any of
                our physical, technical, or managerial safeguards.
              </p>

              <h2>Your Consent</h2>

                you consent to this Privacy Policy.
              </p>

              <h2>Links to Other Websites</h2>
              <p>
                This Privacy Policy applies only to the Services. The Services
                may contain links to other websites not operated or controlled
                by TheTOP.org. We are not responsible for the content, accuracy
                or opinions expressed in such websites, and such websites are
                not investigated, monitored or checked for accuracy or
                completeness by us.
              </p>
              <p>
                Please remember that when you use a link to go from the Services
                to another website, our Privacy Policy is no longer in effect.
                Your browsing and interaction on any other website, including
                those that have a link on our platform, is subject to that
                website’s own rules and policies. Such third parties may use
                their own cookies or other methods to collect information about
                you.

              <h2>Remarketing Services</h2>
              <p>
                We use remarketing services. What Is Remarketing? In digital
                marketing, remarketing (or retargeting) is the practice of
                serving ads across the internet to people who have already
                visited your website. It allows your company to seem like
                they're “following” people around the internet by serving ads on
                the websites and platforms they use most.
              </p>

              <h2>Kids' Privacy</h2>
              <p>
                We do not address anyone under the age of 13. We do not
                knowingly collect personally identifiable information from
                anyone under the age of 13. If You are a parent or guardian and
                You are aware that Your child has provided Us with Personal
                Data, please contact Us. If We become aware that We have
                collected Personal Data from anyone under the age of 13 without
                verification of parental consent, We take steps to remove that
                information from Our servers.
              </p>

              <h2>Changes To Our Privacy Policy</h2>
              <p>
                If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those
                changes on this page, and/or update the Privacy Policy

              <h2>
                Information about General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)
              </h2>
              <p>
                We may be collecting and using information from you if you are
                from the European Economic Area (EEA), and in this section of
                our Privacy Policy we are going to explain exactly how and why
                is this data collected, and how we maintain this data under
                protection from being replicated or used in the wrong way.
              </p>

              <h2>What is GDPR?</h2>
              <p>
                GDPR is an EU-wide privacy and data protection law that
                regulates how EU residents' data is protected by companies and
                enhances the control the EU residents have, over their personal
                data.
              </p>

              <p>
                The GDPR is relevant to any globally operating company and not
                just the EU-based businesses and EU residents. Our customers’
                data is important irrespective of where they are located, which
                is why we have implemented GDPR controls as our baseline
                standard for all our operations worldwide.
              </p>

              <h2>What is personal data?</h2>
              <p>
                Any data that relates to an identifiable or identified
                individual. GDPR covers a broad spectrum of information that
                could be used on its own, or in combination with other pieces of
                information, to identify a person. Personal data extends beyond
                a person’s name or email address. Some examples include
                financial information, political opinions, genetic data,
                biometric data, IP addresses, physical address, sexual
                orientation, and ethnicity.
              </p>

              <p>
                The Data Protection Principles include requirements such as:
              </p>
              <ul class="def-list">
                <li>
                  Personal data collected must be processed in a fair, legal,
